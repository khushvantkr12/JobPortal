# Job-Portal
I built a Job Portal using the MERN stack. Students can sign up, log in, apply for jobs, update their profiles, and track their application status (accepted/rejected). Admins can sign up, log in, add job postings with details (title, salary, JD), and manage applicant status, approving or rejecting applications.

For Students:
User Authentication:
Signup: Register using email and password.
Login: Secure access via email and password authentication.
Job Exploration:
View Jobs: Browse available job listings tailored to user preferences.
Apply for Jobs: Submit applications directly through the platform.
Filter Options: Refine job search based on:
City
Salary Range
Industry
Profile Management:
Update Personal Information: Modify name, phone number, and other personal details.
Skill Enhancement: Add or update skills to enhance employability.
Resume Management: Upload and store resumes securely using Cloudinary.
Application Tracking:
Job Status Monitoring: View the status of job applications, categorized as:
Pending
Rejected
Accepted
