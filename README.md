# Job-Portal
I built a Job Portal using the MERN stack. Students can sign up, log in, apply for jobs, update their profiles, and track their application status (accepted/rejected). Admins can sign up, log in, add job postings with details (title, salary, JD), and manage applicant status, approving or rejecting applications.
