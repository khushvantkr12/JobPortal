# Job-Portal
I built a Job Portal using the MERN stack. Students can sign up, log in, apply for jobs, update their profiles, and track their application status (accepted/rejected). Admins can sign up, log in, add job postings with details (title, salary, JD), and manage applicant status, approving or rejecting applications.


***For Students:

1. User Authentication: JobPortal ensures secure and reliable access for students through a robust authentication system. By registering with their email and password, students can create personalized accounts that safeguard their information. The secure login mechanism guarantees that only authorized users can access their profiles, maintaining the integrity and privacy of their data.

2. Job Exploration: Students can effortlessly navigate through a comprehensive array of job listings tailored to their individual preferences and career aspirations. The platform allows users to browse available opportunities, apply directly through the site, and utilize advanced filtering options to narrow down their search based on specific criteria such as city, salary range, and industry. This targeted approach simplifies the job search process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

3. Profile Management: Maintaining an up-to-date profile is crucial for enhancing employability. JobPortal provides students with the tools to modify personal information, including their name and phone number, ensuring that recruiters have accurate contact details. Additionally, students can add or update their skills, highlighting their competencies and qualifications. The platform integrates Cloudinary for secure resume management, allowing users to upload and store their resumes with ease, ensuring that their application materials are readily accessible to potential employers.

4. Application Tracking: Transparency in the application process is a key feature of JobPortal. Students can monitor the status of their job applications in real-time, categorizing them as pending, rejected, or accepted. This feature provides valuable insights into their job search progress, enabling them to stay informed and make informed decisions regarding their career pursuits.

***For Recruiters:

1. User Authentication: Similar to students, recruiters benefit from a secure authentication system that protects their accounts. By registering with their email and password, recruiters can create dedicated profiles that ensure only authorized personnel can access and manage their job postings and candidate information.

2. Job Posting: JobPortal empowers recruiters to create and publish detailed job listings with ease. Recruiters can define specific job roles, providing comprehensive job descriptions that outline the responsibilities, required qualifications, and necessary skills. The platform allows for the specification of salary ranges and the number of available positions, ensuring that job postings are both informative and attractive to potential candidates. Once crafted, these job listings can be seamlessly posted to the platform, reaching a wide pool of qualified applicants.

3. Candidate Management: Managing applications is streamlined through JobPortalâ€™s intuitive interface. Recruiters can view and manage the pool of students who have applied for their job listings, gaining insights into each candidate's qualifications and suitability. The platform facilitates the acceptance or rejection of applications, allowing recruiters to efficiently shortlist candidates based on their specific requirements and preferences.

4. Advanced Filtering: To enhance the recruitment process further, JobPortal offers advanced filtering options for recruiters. This feature enables them to search and filter job listings based on company preferences, ensuring that they can focus on opportunities that align with their organizational needs and culture. This targeted approach aids in attracting the most suitable candidates, optimizing the recruitment workflow.
